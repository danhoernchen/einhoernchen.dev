Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel ðŸ‘‹
I live in Lower Saxony, Germany, and after a late ADHD diagnosis in my 40s, Iâ€™m starting over. Iâ€™m rebuilding my life around things that actually matter to me: code, design, and creating.

This site is part portfolio, part blog, part workshop. Itâ€™s where I share what Iâ€™m learning â€” from web development to design experiments â€” and also reflect on the journey of figuring out what it means to build something meaningful as an indie developer.

If youâ€™d like to connect, you can reach me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@danhoernchen) or drop me a message right [here](/contact).
