### That’s Me!

Well, not really me — more like me with a little artistic license.

So, a bit about who I am:
I’m Daniel, living in Lower Saxony, Germany. Earlier this year, I was officially diagnosed with ADHD. As a child, I was once tested and given the vague label of “minimal cerebral dysfunction.” I ruled ADHD out after that, even though the symptoms fit. My logic was simple: I’d been tested, it wasn’t ADHD, I just had to try harder.
That mindset carried me for years, but also pushed me into the usual struggles that come with undiagnosed ADHD — co-morbidities, burnout, stumbling from job to job, always trying to “push through.”
Now, with proper treatment, something shifted. Medication makes therapy finally feel like it’s working. The noise in my head is quieter. I sleep better. And reading stories from people with similar experiences gave me hope that I wasn’t alone in this. My outlook changed — and I realized it’s time to start over.

### Rediscovering Code (and Myself)

I’ve always loved code, and the machines that run it. I’ve also always loved art and design. For years, I kept a toe in those worlds, but never let myself really dive in. The last time I was serious about coding, people were debating in IRC whether PHP was a “real” programming language. (So, yes, it’s been a while.)
Now, I want to give this another try — properly this time. I want to build a career (or at least a way of life) around things that actually motivate me and maybe even give me some purpose.
The good news: the resources today are incredible. The Odin Project, FullStackOpen, endless tutorials on YouTube, paid courses, free communities — there’s so much help out there. The bad news: tutorial hell is real. That’s part of why I started this site. Sharing my progress here keeps me accountable, helps me focus, and maybe even helps someone else along the way.

### Why This Site Exists

This space is my workshop, my notebook, my accountability partner. Some of it will be messy. Some of it might be useful. All of it will be real.
If you’re curious, want to connect, or just want to say hi — you can find me through the links below. For now, thanks for reading, and welcome to my little corner of the internet.
