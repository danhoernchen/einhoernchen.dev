A Website created with HTML, CSS and a bit of JS.

## What i learned

- Organizing my CSS in Layers, had not heard of those before and fell in love instantly
- having a "gameplan", design to work towards
- structuring HTML, using placeholders to have something to work with
- structuring my approach, one area at a time
