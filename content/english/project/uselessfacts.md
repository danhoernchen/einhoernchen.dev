**Project Title**
A simple little site that fetches a random useless fact from the [useless facts api](https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl)

**What it is:**

- A bit of html, a bit of css and finally a dash of JS
- built it just to get some exercise using fetch(and css, can never get enough of that)

**Link(s):**

- [Live Demo](https://danhoernchen.github.io/random-facts/)
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/danhoernchen/random-facts)
